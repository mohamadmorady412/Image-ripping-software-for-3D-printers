# Image-ripping-software-for-3D-printers
 Designing a software equipped with an interface that finds GPEG or JPG images, parses them, and converts them into Gcode ready for printing after the intelligent rip process.

# Introduction
Image processing softwares receive the image and perform rip operation on it, they come for execution, whether this execution is printing on a printer or performing operations on a cutting or CNC machine. With the expansion of Web 3 and the development of 3D programs and virtual reality headsets, as well as the development of 3D design software, the idea came to be that an expert intelligent software in the field of preprocessing and conversion of brain microsignals (HSM) to UML Applicable in engineering software It can be very useful. Currently, the software for doing this work are very inefficient and do not have high accuracy, although this issue does not focus on the accuracy of diagnosis, but the more accurate implementation of the designer's ideas can quickly achieve many times.

For this purpose, accurate preprocessing of input data is the solution, and the best format in terms of speed and volume is Gcode. But this format requires a high space cost, as a result, special Fourier series and some control content (game theory) are used to achieve a format whose accuracy and clarity can be adjusted.
